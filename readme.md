## Description

This project recreates the iconic Flappy Bird game within a web browser. Using standard web technologies (HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for logic), the game features dynamically generated pipes, score tracking, and collision detection.  The aim of the game is simple: tap the screen to make the bird flap and navigate through the gaps between the pipes without colliding.

This implementation showcases:

*   **Simple Game Logic:** Clean and understandable JavaScript code for game mechanics.
*   **Dynamic Pipe Generation:** Pipes are randomly generated to increase difficulty.
*   **Collision Detection:**  Accurate collision detection for a fair gameplay experience.
*   **Responsive Design:** The game scales reasonably across different screen sizes. (Further improvements possible!)
